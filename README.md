Another Handbook for Pascal OIers.
=======

This is a handbook for OIers using Pascal to solve problems. You will be provided with useful Pascal skills to help you explore the beauty of OI.

This is mainly based on a `sb.doc` originally written by Saffah, this version is now being rewritten by SCaffrey.

The contents will be written in Chinese for a clearer understanding and feel free to email me if you find any problems in your OI life.

In memory of OI, a never vanished dream!
